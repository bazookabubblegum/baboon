	<h1> Poetry of Nonsense </h1>
	<p>
		How could they know what tides would soon blow,<br />In ancient vacations the mind should not go,<br />Restorational invasion of old implications,<br />Foundations of our senses and mental stations,<br />To be at the end of a double edged sword,<br />Wander the mountains till true self is forged,<br />Forget what you know, for it does no good<br />Alive in ourselves, a will firm like wood.<br />
